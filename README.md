This product is a site where I used vanilla JS to fetch and present a list of random people as a presentation of a team.

I chose to focus on plain vanilla JS instead of using a framework to pracitce my vanilla skills.

The list of people is presentend in alphabetical order which you can toggle in reversable order. You can also search the list for a specific person or basically every person with an "e" in their name.

You can also choose between an list och a grid view by clicking the list and grid icon.
